# Object Oriented Programming in C++

# Abstraction

### Definition
Def 1 : Abstraction is defined as delivering only essential information to the outer world while masking background details, i.e. representing the required information in a program without showing the specifics. Abstraction is a design and programming method that separates the interface from the implementation.

Def 2 : Hiding al unnecessary details and showing only the important parts.
it can be achive using Access Modifiers/Specifiers.

using abstract classes :
1. abtract classes are used to provide a base class from which other classes can be derived.
2. They cannot be instantiated and are meant to be inherited.
3. Abstrct classes are typically used to define an interface for derived classes.
for achiving this we mainly use pure virtual function and assign their values to 0.
